Rossum Assimil8or Preset Creator

You know what I really enjoy? Loading tons of random samples and finding happy accidents. I felt a little down while turning the encoder on my Assimil8or a lot. I was turning it too much. How could I stop turning it so much and get to the point of what I wanted to do?

I know! I'll learn how to write python 3 code and let it fill out tons of presets. Then I don't need to turn that silly encoder anymore.

check_folder.py is a python script that will look in a folder you specify, randomize all of the .wav files found, and then assign them to presets using the values that you set for variables like bit rate, aliasing, etc.

It is a huge work in progress and so far I have only included parameters that I found useful while setting it up for myself. I can see that it needs a lot of work.
