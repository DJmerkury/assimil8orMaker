Rossum Assimil8or Preset Creator

You know what I really enjoy? Loading tons of random samples and finding happy accidents. I felt a little down while turning the encoder on my Assimil8or a lot. I was turning it too much. How could I stop turning it so much and get to the point of what I wanted to do?

I know! I'll learn how to write python 3 code and let it fill out tons of presets. Then I don't need to turn that silly encoder anymore.
